Fish Tank Simulator - WTAK Group Project (CS 142, Fall 2025)
Project Overview
The Fish Tank Simulator is an interactive aquarium ecosystem built in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. Players maintain a balanced tank by managing fish, cleaners, and plants while monitoring waste and algae levels. The simulation demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and event-driven design.
Key Features

Animated GUI: Real-time visual representation of the tank with moving fish, roaming cleaners, growing plants, and a dynamic waste progress bar.
Interactive Controls: Buttons to feed the tank, clean waste, and add new fish, cleaners, or plants.
Ecosystem Dynamics:
Fish swim horizontally and produce waste
Cleaners roam and reduce waste/algae
Three plant types with different growth rates and waste absorption abilities
Algae spreads when waste is high, darkening the water visually
Tank becomes toxic at 80% waste, killing animals

Real-time Updates: Simulation runs on a 1-second timer with continuous animation and state changes

How to Run

Compile all .java files:textjavac *.java
Run the simulation:textjava TankGUI

The main window will open with the animated tank. Use the buttons at the bottom to interact with the simulation.
